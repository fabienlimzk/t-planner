#### Project Objectives
**Technical Requirements**
Your app must:
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end.
- Be a complete product, which means that it is usable from head-to-tail, in the environment it is meant for.
- Implement thoughtful user stories that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
- Be accessible online

Your app should:
- Use a database or way to store your data, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
- Have an interactive front-end
